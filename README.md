## CSE 535 Project 4
### Guardian Angel: Hospital Navigation System 

#### Introduction:
With intricate designs and structures of Hospitals and Medical Centers, equipped with multiple departments and facilities, along with its time-sensitive nature of the environment, it has become of utmost importance to build a Guardian Angel, an application that guides and navigates the users across the physical infrastructures of the Hospitals and Medical Centers. 

#### Tasks:
- Database Creation using Room DB Android Library 
- Building profiles for the users - Doctors and Patients
- Building the Main Page along with Navigation for Doctor and Patient
- Managing data flow between UI and the database
- Displaying the Patient details from the database to the allocated Doctor
  
#### Design
The project is designed to provide the following essential features and functionalities:
1. User input and profiling – In this functionality, different user profiles are built based on their role such as Doctor, Patient, etc. 
2. Patient Symptoms – In this feature, the symptoms and health-based metrics of the patient are collected. For instance, the patient’s Name, Age, Height, Weight, Heart Rate, etc. 
3. Database Creation – One of the most essential features of this application is to store the data in a persistent database in order to perform real-time analysis and provide real-time updates to the user. 
4. Real-Time Updates – The application is integrated with Google Maps API in order to compute the current travel time to the medical center in case of emergencies. 
5. Real-Time Monitoring – The application also provides a real-time Patient Dashboard that contains the details of the patients assigned to a doctor. This dashboard is integrated with the database in order to receive real-time updates of the data. 

#### Project Dependencies:
- Android Room DB - Used to setup the database for the application
- Compose - Jetpack compose, android UI toolkit used to build the UI components for the application
